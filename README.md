# About Me
## My Hobbies
* I love to play the guitar, however I'm not very good at it.
* I go Country Swing dancing every Thursday and Sunday night at Whiskey Rose in Raleigh.
## Websites I Recommend
* [YouTube](www.youtube.com) - It's a great website to find videos about any of your interests or hobbies.
* [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/) - This website is a favorite for when I'm bored and have nothing to do. It takes you to a random useless website that hopefully you'll enjoy and cure your boredom.
